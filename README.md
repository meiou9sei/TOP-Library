# TOP-Library
javascript practice, library project

!! this project is backburner for now

live here but it's unfinished: https://meiou9sei.github.io/TOP-Library/

going to rewrite it someday, maybe

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

gotta rewrite it with myLibrary and local storage as a focus

https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library


WHEN WORKING ON READ/NOT READ NEXT:
- have that toggle on button click
- have it also run a function, which checks the new true/false value, that sets css or not
- also change the myLibrary status


todo list:
- Add a button on each book’s display to change its read status.
    - To facilitate this you will want to create the function that toggles a book’s read status on your Book prototype instance.
- assign unique ID's to books and make them removable from myLibrary 
- store books in local
    - have them fill up myLibrary 
    - display myLibrary on screen
    - store new books to myLibrary and local

    ...i'm not sure why we have a myLibrary when it seems like you don't need one? idk
