todo list:
- basic css for site
    - header
    - footer
    - card-display
- css for new book
    - appears when click "new book" on top of everythign else
    - disappears if "cancel" or did add new book


- Add a button on each book’s display to remove the book from the library. 
    - You will need to associate your DOM elements with the actual book objects in some way. One easy solution is giving them a data-attribute that corresponds to the index of the library array.
- Add a button on each book’s display to change its read status. 
    - To facilitate this you will want to create the function that toggles a book’s read status on your Book prototype instance.
- make cards draggable to change index in array / display
