todo list:
- Add a button on each book’s display to change its read status.
    - To facilitate this you will want to create the function that toggles a book’s read status on your Book prototype instance.
- assign unique ID's to books and make them removable from myLibrary 
- store books in local
    - have them fill up myLibrary 
    - display myLibrary on screen
    - store new books to myLibrary and local

    ...i'm not sure why we have a myLibrary when it seems like you don't need one? idk
